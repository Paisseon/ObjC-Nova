# ObjC-Nova

The first, best, and thus far only [Nova](https://nova.app) extension for C, Objective-C, and Logos highlighting. ObjC-Nova is a syntax highlighter. It is not an autocompletion extension, a server-sided compiler, or anything else that can't be done in RegEx. But it highlights (Objective) C and Logos code pretty well.

Please submit feature requests, bug reports, or pictures of Emilia-tan to u/Paisseon on Reddit or @EMT#0001 on Discord. I won't see anything on GitHub.
